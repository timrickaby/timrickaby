ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm a designer and developer crafting brand identities, digital design, websites and short-form copy to deliver creative, technical and strategic solutions which are unique, meaningful and effective.
<br /><br />
As a designer I've worked agency-side with global brands and in-house with many wonderful SMEâ€™s, family businesses, charities and musicians. Right now I'm the design manager at leading wool and craft brand West Yorkshire Spinners and I create bespoke work for private clients through my small studio, Modocodo.
<br /><br />
Iâ€™m also a self-taught developer with a love for technology. Iâ€™ve built a couple of side projects in PHP and recently released Awesome Exporter â€“ an Adobe InDesign extension written in JavaScript which enables studios and publishers to simplify the delivery of artwork, assets and multi-lingual editorial files.
